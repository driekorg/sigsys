function [direction] = CalcDir(signal1, signal2)
%CALCDIR Calculates direction of the signals
%   given complex signals1 and 2, the direction is calculated by first
%   calculating de phase differences in rad. This is then converted to
%   seconds which is then used to calculate the direction. The direction is
%   returned in degrees.
